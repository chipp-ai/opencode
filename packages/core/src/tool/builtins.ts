/**
 * Composes only the shipped Location-scoped built-in tool transforms.
 * Each tool retains its implementation and focused tests independently. Dynamic
 * MCP and plugin tools later use separate scoped canonical registrations, while
 * provider/model filtering belongs to a future materialization phase rather
 * than this static list. The caller intentionally supplies shared Location
 * services once to this merged set.
 *
 * TODO: Port the remaining launch-follow-up leaves deliberately: edit fuzzy
 * parity, LSP, repo_clone, repo_overview, plan_exit, and Rune/code mode. Keep
 * MCP and plugin transforms separate from this static built-in list.
 *
 * `task` is deliberately NOT here despite being ported (see `./task.ts`'s own module comment):
 * it needs `SessionV2.Service`, which itself depends (through `location-service-map.ts`) on the
 * same location bootstrap this file composes into -- including it here would close a real
 * dependency cycle. It's composed as a separate node alongside `SessionV2.node` at the server's
 * own top-level composition instead.
